      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Matt and I really like code. I'm also front-end developer. Coincidence? I think not. Before learning to code I worked as a line chef in the metro Atlanta area, but since hanging up my appron I've picked up a laptop and started down the path of programming. In the pursuit of knowledge I surrounded myself with motivated people and mentors on the same path, and learned something frome every single one of them, so it should come to no surprise that I'm looking for more brains to pick. I am currently looking for web developement teams to contribute to and learn from. Get in touch with me so we can cook up some code together!

            <h3>Cook for Me</h3>
            <p>
              This is a work in progress for me and sort of a labor of love. It's a fairlry simple application made with professional cooks in mind. The idea is for cooks to be able to go online, create a profile, add dishes to their individual menus, and make themselves available for hire. This was also my first time seriously working with Angular.js, and certainly not my last time.

              This is a basic blogging application built in backbone with the help of a former classmate. You can register and authenticate users, create and publish drafts, and comment on other users posts.

              Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that this is just my github repo, and that you could have just clicked that convenient little link at the top of the page , or at the bottom for that matter. Well you're half right. This isi actually the result of my attmepts at creating a pixel perfect replica of my github page.
